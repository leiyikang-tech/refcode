"""Measure whether a deep-dive recursive self-improvement actually helped.

Replaces the "the LLM pats itself on the back" hand-wave with a measurable
regression: a playbook/methodology change is only accepted if the error
recurrence rate dropped after the change. The BEFORE/AFTER split is by deep-dive
layer. Errors recorded at layer <= --before-layer are the BEFORE cohort (the
state of the world before the improvement); errors at layer > --before-layer are
the AFTER cohort (the state after the improvement).

A methodology change is only accepted when:
  - the AFTER cohort actually has data (>=1 run, so the fix ran and produced
    evidence rather than being asserted), AND
  - AFTER recurrence rate is strictly lower than BEFORE recurrence rate.

This is a light, deterministic comparison tool, not an ML eval. It never writes
to any table and never judges the LLM's confidence - only SQL-checkable facts.

CLI:
  regression_check.py --project <path> [--db /root/.sisyphus/db/analysis.db] [--before-layer N]

Exit codes:
  0  PASS               - AFTER has data and its recurrence rate < BEFORE's
  1  INSUFFICIENT_DATA  - no AFTER runs yet; improvement cannot be claimed
  1  NO_IMPROVEMENT     - AFTER recurrence rate >= BEFORE (no gain / worsening)
  2  ERROR              - bad CLI args / DB open failure
