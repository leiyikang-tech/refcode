# Incremental Analysis Protocol (项目刷新 + 核心领域新增)

Read this **before** starting any repo-map run to decide which baseline mode
applies. It answers: *am I analyzing fresh, refreshing a mapped project, or
adding to a known domain?* Modes differ in what counts as "known" and therefore
what work is *delta* vs *full*.

Two baseline modes (they can combine):

| Mode | Baseline is | Trigger | What's delta |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Fresh** | nothing | first analysis of a path | everything (full 5-op) |
| **Refresh** | this project's last-analyzed git state | project already mapped + re-run | the git diff since last-mapped sha |
| **Same-domain** | the A-paradigm bin's existing assets | new project lands on an existing paradigm (A1–A12 with prior analyses) | alignment to the bin (competitors/papers/gaps already known) |

`Refresh` and `Same-domain` share one rule that defines the whole protocol:
**search the delta against your baseline, never re-scan the whole landscape.**
The taxonomy (`references/taxonomy/KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`) is what makes a
"delta" well-defined: Refresh diffs against the *project*, Same-domain diffs
against the *paradigm bin* — both are deterministic now.

## 0. Baseline detection (do this first, every run)

```bash
# 0a) Resolve the project's canonical identity BEFORE baseline lookup.
#     Two clones of the SAME GitHub project (different dirs/versions) MUST NOT
#     become two baselines. Identity = git origin remote, normalized to
#     '<owner>/<repo>' (credentials stripped, .git dropped), NOT the local path.
python3 - <<'PY'
import subprocess, sys, os, sqlite3
db=os.path.expanduser("/root/.sisyphus/db/analysis.db")
path=os.path.abspath(sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv)>1 else ".")
con=sqlite3.connect(db)
def norm(url):
    if not url: return None
    url=url.strip()
    # scp-style git@host:owner/repo.git
    m=__import__('re').match(r"(?:[^@]+@)?([^:/]+):(.+?)(?:\.git)?$",url)
    if m and "github.com" in m.group(1): return m.group(2).lstrip("/").rstrip("/")
    # https-style (with optional credentials)
    m=__import__('re').match(r"https?://(?:[^@/]+@)?[^/]+/(.+?)(?:\.git)?$",url)
    if m: return m.group(1).rstrip("/")
    return url.rstrip("/") if __import__('re').match(r"^[^/]+/[^/]+$",url) else None
remote=subprocess.run(["git","-C",path,"config","--get","remote.origin.url"],
                      capture_output=True,text=True).stdout.strip() if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(path,".git")) else ""
rem=norm(remote)
# Is this identity already baselined under a DIFFERENT local path?
row=con.execute("SELECT repo_path, last_analyzed_sha, mapped_at FROM project_baselines WHERE remote_path=?",(rem,)).fetchone() if rem else None
print("canonical remote_path:", rem if rem else "NONE (local-only)")
print("existing baseline via remote:", row if row else "NONE")
# Baseline lookup by local path (for local-only projects, or exact-path runs)
r=con.execute("SELECT last_analyzed_sha, paradigm_id, mapped_at FROM project_baselines WHERE repo_path=?",(path,)).fetchone()
print("baseline by path:", r if r else "NONE -> Fresh")
PY
# 0b) If baselined: how much changed since?
git -C <repo> log -1 --format=%H              # current HEAD
git -C <repo> diff --stat <last_analyzed_sha>..HEAD  # the delta
```

Classification (deterministic, in this order):

**Step A — identity dedup (the `remote_path` guard).** If the run's target resolves
to a `remote_path` that already has a `project_baselines` row under a **different
local path**, this is a **second clone of the same GitHub project** → **never a
Fresh run, never a new baseline row**:
- canonical `repo_path` = the row the `remote_path` already points to.
- compare this clone's HEAD vs `last_analyzed_sha` of the canonical row:
  - same sha → **no-op** (this clone adds nothing; reuse the canonical analysis).
  - newer sha → **Refresh** on the canonical row (delta from `last_analyzed_sha`;
    update the canonical row's `last_analyzed_sha`, do NOT insert a new row —
    the UNIQUE index on `remote_path` rejects it anyway).
  - older sha → **no-op** + note "a newer version is already analyzed at
    `<canonical_repo_path>`"; do not regress the baseline.
- Record the decision in the run output (`auto: identity dedup via remote_path
  <owner/repo> → canonical <repo_path>`). This is the mechanism that prevents
  two directories of one GitHub project from producing two analyses.

**Step B — normal path baseline classification** (only reached if Step A found no
`remote_path` match, i.e. this is a genuinely new identity or a local-only repo):
- No `project_baselines` row → **Fresh** (full 5-op).
- Row exists AND `git diff` non-empty → **Refresh** (delta Op1/Op2/Op4; Op3 re-check).
- Row exists AND no diff (unchanged) → **no-op** — tell user nothing changed, skip work.
- (either of the above) AND the A-paradigm has prior analyses in its bin →
  ALSO qualifies as **Same-domain** where bin assets define the Op3 baseline.

## 1. Refresh mode — project-version delta (git-diff driven)

Goal: update a mapped project for what **changed since last analysis**, without
re-discovering/re-generating the whole thing. Only the delta is analyzed; the
map's stable parts stay untouched.

### 1.1 Compute the delta
```bash
git -C <repo> diff --name-status <last_sha>..HEAD      # M/A/D/R per file
git -C <repo> diff --stat  <last_sha>..HEAD            # size signal
git -C <repo> log --oneline <last_sha>..HEAD           # what was done
```
Changes that matter → **Op1 delta scope**:
- `A` (added) new module / new language / new entrypoint → score + doc IF distinct domain
- `M` (modified) touched existing dir → re-verify that dir's AGENTS.md still true, **edit** only the stale lines
- `D` (deleted) removed module → **remove** its per-dir AGENTS.md (or fold to parent)
- `R` (renamed) → update the doc's header path, keep body
- dependency/stack change (package.json/pyproject/deps add/remove) → re-run G2 detect_stack + G5

### 1.2 Op1 delta mechanics (do NOT rerun discovery/scoring/generate wholesale)
1. **scope** = dirs/files in the diff only; read those entrypoints + configs, spawn
   explore agents ONLY for the touched clumps (dynamic-scale per delta size, not repo size).
2. **edit, don't rewrite**: `edit` the affected AGENTS.md; unchanged docs untouched.
   Update the `Generated | Commit` header to the new sha.
3. Re-run G1–G5 (cheap file checks) to re-certify the whole map still holds;
   re-run `gates.py g6` only if the project's source changed (refcode index is stale).
4. If the delta changes the verdicts (new deps, new entrypoint, different stack):
   re-verify and record it.

### 1.3 Re-classify paradigm (A-axis can drift)
The diff may move the project to a new/additional paradigm (e.g. it gained a
search feature → A1 → A1+A2). Re-run the §3.1 taxonomy classification on the
**delta**; update `project_baselines.paradigm_id` if it changed.

### 1.4 Op2 ~ Op5 on refresh
- **Op2**: regenerate only the sections affected by the delta (new core fns /
  scenarios / limits); keep stable claims.
- **Op3**: do NOT re-benchmark the whole landscape. Check only: did the delta
  add a new capability worth comparing? Same-domain bin handles deep compare.
- **Op4**: the diff may **fill a previously-recorded gap** → bump that gap's
  `progress` 0→1. It may add a new gap → append. This is how the closed loop
  actually turns.
- **Op5**: persist the delta as an *update* to the existing distinctive-named
  file (one subject = one file; edit in place, re-push), plus any new assets.

### 1.5 Update the baseline
```sql
-- UPSERT: identity-keyed. If this repo's remote_path is already baselined under
-- another path (a second clone), UPDATE only — never INSERT a new row (the
-- UNIQUE index on remote_path enforces one baseline per GitHub project).
INSERT INTO project_baselines(repo_path, last_analyzed_sha, paradigm_id, artifacts, mapped_at, remote_path)
VALUES (<repo_path>, <new HEAD>, ?, ?, now, <owner/repo>)
ON CONFLICT(repo_path) DO UPDATE SET
  last_analyzed_sha=excluded.last_analyzed_sha,
  paradigm_id=excluded.paradigm_id,
  artifacts=excluded.artifacts,
  mapped_at=now,
  remote_path=excluded.remote_path;
```

---

## 2. Same-domain mode — paradigm-bin delta (reuse, don't rescan)

Goal: analyze a new project that sits in a paradigm (A1–A12) we already know.
The bin's **existing assets are the baseline** — competitors, papers, domain
surveys, gap progress. We only locate this project's *difference* within the
bin, then fold its findings back in.

### 2.1 Assemble the bin baseline (WHAT to reuse — this is the speed win)
```sql
-- known competitors / comparisons in this bin
SELECT name_zh, dispatch FROM project_paradigms WHERE paradigm_id=<A>;
-- gaps & opportunities already tracked in this bin
SELECT kind,id,description,progress FROM v_op4_open_items WHERE domain=<A>;
```
Plus: prior work-log competitive analyses in the bin (Axis D residence dirs) and
the bin's `capabilities.md` rows. **This is your starting search surface** — you
do not re-discover it.

### 2.2 Locate the delta (what's NEW vs the bin)
Only three questions; everything else is already known:
1. **New mechanism?** Does this project add a bottom-layer mechanism the bin
   hasn't catalogued? (→ new capability row, possible taxonomy-extension if a
   genuine new paradigm)
2. **Fills a tracked gap?** Does it solve a `project_gaps` row in this bin →
   bump that gap's `progress`.
3. **Differentiates how?** vs the bin's already-compared competitors — a NEW row
   in the existing comparison matrix, not a full re-survey (10-dim template
   applies only to the new entrant vs the bin's leaders, not vs every prior tool).

### 2.3 Anti-hallucination + reuse guard
- Only the delta claims are NEW; inherited bin claims stay attributed to the bin,
  not re-verified ad nauseam.
- If the project is a me-too (no new mechanism, fills nothing, doesn't
  differentiate) → say so plainly; don't fabricate differentiation to justify
  another report.

### 2.4 Close the loop
- Append the new capability/mechanism to the bin's `capabilities.md` + Op4 store.
- Op5: persist one distinctive file in the bin's residence dir
  (`<domain>/<subject>作为<role>的<analysis-type>.md`).
- Update `project_baselines` for this project.

## 3. Combining the modes (refresh of a known-domain project)

A project already mapped that also belongs to a known bin → both apply:
- **Refresh** handles the project-version delta (1.1–1.5).
- **Same-domain** handles bin-alignment for any NEW capability the refresh
  surfaced in 1.4 (2.2–2.4).
Run Refresh first, then Same-domain on the resulting new-capability set.

---

## 4. Baseline store (analysis.db `project_baselines`)

New table (apply with `references/taxonomy/incremental.sql`):
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS project_baselines (
  repo_path        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  last_analyzed_sha TEXT,          -- git HEAD the map was generated at
  paradigm_id      TEXT,           -- A1..A12 primary (axis A)
  artifacts        TEXT,           -- json: {root_kb, dirs[], profile, comparison}
  mapped_at        TEXT,           -- ISO timestamp
  remote_path      TEXT            -- canonical '<owner>/<repo>' from git origin (nullable)
);
-- Identity dedup guard: one GitHub project == one baseline, regardless of clone dir.
-- Partial unique index: local-only repos (remote_path NULL) are never constrained.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_baselines_remote
  ON project_baselines(remote_path) WHERE remote_path IS NOT NULL;
```
`remote_path` is the **project identity** (`git remote origin` → `owner/repo`,
credentials stripped); `repo_path` is only **where it lives**. Refresh / dedup
logic keys on `remote_path` (Step A in §0), never on `repo_path` alone, so a
second clone of an already-mapped project is recognized as the same project.
Backfill existing rows with: `git -C <dir> config --get remote.origin.url`
normalized (see §0 Step A `norm()`); local-only dirs keep NULL.
