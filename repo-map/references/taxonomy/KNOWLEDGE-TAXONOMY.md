# Knowledge & Key-Technology Classification Taxonomy (确定性知识/关键技术分类体系)

**Status:** v1.0 seeded — Determined, extensible
**Seed source:** work-log 领域目录体系 (31 top-level domains) + analysis.db 151 topics + research-kb multi-axis precedent

Read this **before** Op3 (comparative research) and **before** Op4 (gap/opportunity).
It is the **deterministic** lens that routes every new project to the right
search plan and the right gap/opportunity aggregation bin — replacing the
per-project "guess what to search" with a fixed, repeatable classification.

---

## 0. Why this taxonomy exists (the contract)

Without it, each new project asks "what should I compare / what gap does it
fill" from scratch. With it, every project is **classified up-front** into a
fixed set of orthogonal dimensions, so:

- **Op3 dispatch is deterministic** — the paradigm category tells you *which*
  competitors to sweep, *whether* papers matter, *whether* a domain survey is
  warranted. No more "I think it's an agent framework".
- **Op4 aggregation is coherent** — gaps/opportunities are binned by paradigm,
  so the same paradigm's concurrent/prior projects accumulate into *one*
  evolving picture instead of scattering across 31 loose directories.
- **It is extensible, not closed** — a category is added only when it earns a
  genuine NEW underlying mechanism (see §4 registration rules), never for a
  new product name.

---

## 1. The classification is MULTI-AXIS, not a single tree

Work-log's 31 directories look like one tree but actually mix FOUR orthogonal
dimensions. This taxonomy separates them — that separation is what makes
search precision improve. Classify every project against axes A / B / C; keep
D for accounting.

| Axis | What it answers | Purpose | Who consumes it |
|------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| **A. Technology Paradigm** | *What underlying mechanism does it embody?* | Op3 dispatch + Op4 aggregation bin | Op3 / Op4 |
| **B. Project Nature** | *Platform vs capability vs domain-knowledge?* | Op3 research-path split | Op3 |
| **C. Capability** | *What reusable atomic capabilities does it prove?* | Op3.5 atomic-capability register + reuse | Op3 / Op4 (opportunity) |
| **D. Storage Source** | *Which work-log dir holds it?* (accounting, NOT a domain) | Op5 persistence + dedup | Op5 |

**Critical rule:** D (work-log directory) is a *storage bucket*, NOT a domain.
`深度研究`, `AI功能分析`, `AI协作分析`, `demo` are ANALYSIS MODES (a B/C
concern), and `agentos`, `hermes-harness`, `skillsos`, `cangjie-skill` are
PRODUCT PACKAGE MIRRORS — none of them belong in the A axis. This is the exact
conflation the work-log tree suffers, and the first thing this taxonomy fixes.

---

## Axis A — Technology Paradigm Registry (the core of the taxonomy)

The **A axis is the spine**. Each paradigm is the aggregation bin for Op3
(dispatcher) and Op4 (gap/opportunity store). Seeded from work-log's *real*
low-level domains; each row carries: definition · judge-keywords (from Op1
evidence) · work-log residence · search dispatch.

### A-axis usage protocol (Op3/Op4, deterministic)

1. From Op1/Op2 **evidence**, assign a project to **1 primary + 0..2 secondary**
   A-paradigms (keywords from the table, not the README).
2. The **primary** paradigm dictates the dominant Op3 search path (its `Op3
   dispatch` column) and the **Op4 gap/opportunity aggregation bin** (the
   `project_gaps.domain` / `project_opportunities.domain`).
3. Secondary paradigms add *convergence signals* for Op4 opportunities (≥3
   independent analyses on that paradigm → promote).
4. A project may cross paradigms (e.g. GraphRAG = A2+A4) — that's an *opportunity
   seed*, not an error. Always record the primary bin.

---

## Axis B — Project Nature (from existing Op3.1, now deterministic)

Classify from evidence, then map to the mandatory dispatch:

| Nature | Evidence | Op3 research actions |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| 平台 / 架构类 | framework/runtime/platform/full-stack skeleton, layered modules | high-similarity **competitor** deep-dive |
| 能力 / 关键技术类 | algorithms, DSP, low-level libs, single sharp mechanism | competitive **+ deep paper search** |
| 综合性 (capability+platform) | both | both **+ 7-layer landscape benchmark** |
| 领域知识高价值 | domain-heavy, data/ontology rich, benchmarks | **+ single-topic knowledge survey** |

`Axes B + A-primary` together fully determine the Op3 plan. B says *how deep*;
A says *in which bin*.

---

## Axis C — Capability (atomic ability register)

The reusable-atomic-capability cross-index (precedent: research-kb `by-capability`,
988 capabilities). When Op3.5 promotes a verified capability, tag it here.

Capability tag = `{verb}-{object}-{mechanism}` (e.g. `retrieve-hybrid-community-detection`,
`embed-memory-consolidation`). Register in the capability index (see `capabilities.md`).

---

## Axis D — Work-log storage bucket (accounting only)

Where Op5 persists. Maps A-primary → default work-log dir. **D is a bucket, not a
domain** — same bucket may hold multiple A-paradigms' files.

---

## 4. Extensibility — the registration rules (WHAT earns a new category)

A keeper taxonomy must grow only on genuine signal, or search precision rots.

### Add a NEW A-paradigm when (all three):
1. **New bottom-layer mechanism** observed (a distinct API/algo/protocol/kernel,
   not a new product name or a re-label of an existing paradigm).
2. **Evidence-backed** (≥1 Op1/Op2 code-path or doc anchor; marker doc in work-log).
3. **Non-overlapping** with existing A1–A12 (fails the "is it really not A2/A4?"
   test → fold into the existing bin, don't fork).

### Do NOT add for:
- A new **product** (addressing the same paradigm) → keep in the pod's bin.
- A new **work-log directory** (Axes D) → directories can be added freely for
  storage; that is NOT an A-axis change.
- A new **analysis-mode folder** (深度研究/AI功能分析/...) → those are B/C, not A.

### The two-step extension flow
```
Propose → 1) locate nearest existing paradigm  →  if fits, absorb (record link)
         → 2) if genuinely orthogonal + evidenced → open new paradigm, update
             this registry + analysis.db + work-log reference
```

## 5. Where this taxonomy lives (single source of truth + mirrors)

| Surface | Role |
|---------|------|
| **this file** (`references/taxonomy/KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`) | authoritative registry |
| `references/taxonomy/capabilities.md` | Axis C atomic-capability index (grows per project) |
| analysis.db `project_gaps.domain` / `project_opportunities.domain` | Op4 bins = A-paradigm id (A1–A12) |
| work-log A-paradigm residence dirs | persistent human-readable docs (Axis D) |

Update this registry **before** Op3/Op4 run on a project exhibiting a possibly-new
paradigm; the classification decision is deterministic and precedes search.

## 6. Status & seed provenance

- v1.0 seeded from: work-log 31 top-level domains (office canonical, 585 md),
  analysis.db 151 topics, research-kb multi-axis precedent (by-domain /
  by-capability / gap-analysis / maturity).
- Confirmed dimension-split: `深度研究`/`AI功能分析`/`AI协作分析`/`demo` are
  **analysis modes (B/C)**; `agentos`/`hermes-harness`/`skillsos`/`cangjie-skill`
  are **product mirrors (D)**; `channel`/`data`/`信息源` are **catch-alls (D)**.
- Next: backfill each A-paradigm's Op4 bin from existing analysis.db rows, and
  seed `capabilities.md` from existing work-log competitive analyses.
