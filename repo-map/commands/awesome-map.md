# awesome-map — waitlist + on-demand analysis of an awesome list's member projects

Calls **repo-map's awesome-list branch** (SKILL.md §awesome-list mode). No
duplicate logic. The TARGET is the awesome list's **member projects**, NOT the
list README itself.

## Flow

1. **Parse all**: extract ALL member projects AND papers from the README
   (title, URL, category, stars, description, source_type, vendor).
2. **Score + rank ALL (automatic)**: every entry gets a `value_score` via
   `value = .35*gap_fill + .20*paradigm_relevance + .25*novelty + .15*atomic_value + .05*maintenance`.
   `gap_fill` = fills an unfilled `project_open_items` item (73 gap + 29 opp
   open, concentrated in A1/A10/A12/A3/A7); `novelty` = differs from the ~545
   already-analyzed docs (247 repos/631 papers); `atomic_value` = real bottom-layer
   mechanism vs link-collection. stars is a TIEBREAKER, never the sort key.
   **Consistency**: ranking reads a frozen gap-board snapshot (never writes it) +
   deterministic rule-scoring → reproducible, order-independent.
3. **UPSERT ranked results**: every entry into `analysis_index` with
   status='waitlisted', recording `source_type` (github/arxiv/blog),
   `core_functions` (awesome/README description + paper abstract one-liner) +
   `why_worth` + `value_score` + 5 component scores. Idempotent.
4. **Auto deep-dive in rank order**: iterate `waitlisted` by `value_score DESC`,
   each entry automatically (optionally capped to top N / value threshold),
   branching on `source_type`:
   - `github` → clone to `/root/.sisyphus/repos/<org>/<repo>/` (persistent
     full clone) → standard repo-map pipeline (Op1 → Op2 → Op3 → Op4 → Op5)
   - `arxiv`/`blog` → **paper analysis** (op1-init-deep.md 分支 B): ALL papers are
     surface-analyzed — webfetch abstract → extract core mechanism → map paradigm
     → score → ingest (waitlist is a REGISTRATION state, NOT "skipped-unread";
     every paper must complete surface analysis). deep-dive only papers that are
     high-value OR fill an open `project_open_items` gap OR hit a surprise signal
     (novel mechanism / cross-paradigm / high influence / unique method)
   → set status='analyzed' + analysis_path + n_gaps + n_opportunities after each.
   This phase may write the gap board; the ranking phase never does.
5. **Sync to GitHub**: after enqueueing the ranked results and/or after each
   deep-dive: `git add -A && git commit && git push` to sync `analysis_index`
   + analysis artifacts to the work-log repo.

**Completion signal (hardened — same contract as repo-map):** every finished
stage prints a loud marker carrying its Q-gate verdict; the run ALWAYS ends with
a completion block — **success and failure alike**:

report — never a silent stop. Do not end on silence or a vague trailing sentence.
